## Code Details
- Very simple code
- To play the game again after Game Over, you have to exit the game and start the game again (there is no TRY AGAIN button)
- The code is modular and a few things can be changed like velocity of obstacles, jump height of the bird etc..
- The game does not become difficult as it progresses (very simple game ;))
